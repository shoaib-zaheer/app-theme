| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Watched The Tutorial__ | **For** week-2 `Incremental-development` week assignment, i started by watching the video first up to end then i start to write code  |   |  |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Live Boilerplate__ | **Created** primary files `index.html` folder for `IMG` and folder for `style.css` sheet, without making big changes I tried to keep more focus. How `github` branching work by continuously `push` `pull` `merge` all my files with github. | Boilerplate for `index.html`| An empty folder |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Creating CSS file__ | **After** completeing `index.html` and knowing every `section` and parts of html it is easy to write `CSS` codes and use them for more then one `section` i did not writie for every `tag` separate `CSs` code | `form` `input` `button` `aside` | Created CSS file for `index.html` & linked it to `inbex.html` |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Writing About me page__| **Nice** to know i can write all `CSS` codes for one project in one single `CSS` page, and i don't have to wirte alot of codes just simple changes | (what did you add to the HTML?) | Creating `dark` and `sidebar` classes and update some begud from my `CSS` file |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Creating Service page__ | For making Service it is similer to About page but i learn making `form` in `HTML5` is easy | `form`, `lable` for email `textara` for writing text with `placeholder` & `button` to submit | `width` & `padding` for `sidebar` and its `text` `li` ruls for `services` ID and `ul` |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Responsivnes of page as per user device__ | **Knowing** that we can usd one ``media` code for complete project is nice, and adding every `ID` `class` just using `.` but for some indviual we can make as set of rools in same `media` | Nothing | `@media` ruls for complete project |
